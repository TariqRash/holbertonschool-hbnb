# HBnB Evolution

A comprehensive AirBnB-like application demonstrating enterprise-grade software architecture and design patterns.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is part of Holberton School's Advanced Backend Specialization, showcasing:
- **Layered Architecture** (Presentation, Business Logic, Persistence)
- **Design Patterns** (Facade, Repository, MVC)
- **UML Modeling** and comprehensive technical documentation
- **RESTful API** design principles

## 🚀 Current Phase: Part 1 - Technical Documentation

### Deliverables
- ✅ High-Level Package Diagram (3-layer architecture)
- ✅ Detailed Class Diagram (Business Logic entities)
- ✅ Sequence Diagrams (4 API interaction flows)
- ✅ Compiled Technical Documentation (PDF)

### Architecture Overview

The application follows a **three-layer architecture**:

1. **Presentation Layer** - API services and user interfaces
2. **Business Logic Layer** - Core models and business rules
3. **Persistence Layer** - Database operations and data access

Communication between layers is facilitated through the **Facade Pattern**.

## 🏗️ Core Entities

- **User** - Account management and authentication
- **Place** - Property listings with location and pricing
- **Review** - User feedback and ratings for places
- **Amenity** - Reusable features for places (WiFi, Pool, etc.)

## 📚 Documentation

All technical documentation is located in the [`part1/`](./part1/) directory:
- Package Diagram with architectural overview
- Class Diagram with entity relationships
- Sequence Diagrams for key API operations
- Complete technical specifications

## 🔧 Technologies

- **Diagrams:** Mermaid.js (renders natively on GitHub)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Documentation:** Markdown, PDF
- **Future Implementation:** Python 3.x, Flask/FastAPI, PostgreSQL

## 🤝 Contributing
